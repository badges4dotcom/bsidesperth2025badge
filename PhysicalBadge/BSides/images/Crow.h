//
//  Run Length Encoded (RLE) bitmaps.  Each run is encoded as either one or two bytes,
//  with NO PADDING.  Thus, the data for each line of the bitmap is VARIABLE LENGTH, and
//  there is no way of determining where any line other than the first starts without
//  walking though the data.  
//
//  Note that one byte encoding ONLY occurs if the total number of colors is 16 or less,
//  and in that case the 'flags' member of the 'RLEBitmapInfo' will have the first bit
//  (0x01) set.
//
//  In that case, if the high 4 bits of the first byte are ZERO, then this is a 2 byte
//  run.  The first byte is the index of the color in the color palette, and the second
//  byte is the length.
//
//  Else, the lower 4 bits are the color index, and the upper 4 bits are the run length.
//
//  If the 'flags' member first bit is zero, then ALL runs are 2 byte runs.  The first
//  byte is the palette index, and the second is the run length.
//
//  In order to save PROGMEM for other uses, the bitmap data is placed in a section that
//  occurs near the END of the used FLASH.  So, this data should only be accessed using
//  the 'far' versions of the progmem functions - the usual versions are limited to the
//  first 64K of FLASH.
//
//  Data is from file 'D:\Archive\Extracts\Small\24bit\Crow.bmp'.
